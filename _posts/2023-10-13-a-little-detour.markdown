## Trading bot
While still looking for the next ideas worth validating for some SaaS, I'm taking a little detour.
I've always wanted to write a trading bot for learning purposes.
Right now I'm professionally connected to parts of trading systems and I want to have a better understanding of the whole spectrum.
I've decided to write a simple crypto-trading bot that would trade with some very simple strategies like a variation on moving average crossover.

I want to write a simple, but clean, tested trading engine. 

Onwards!
