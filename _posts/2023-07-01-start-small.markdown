# Start somewhere, even if it's small.

## Setting Sail on the SaaS Sea

It's essential to start somewhere, no matter how small. Over the next few years, my big aim is to live off my own projects. Some might argue the SaaS domain is already crowded, but I still believe there's room for innovative services. Advances in VR and AI might open doors to a ton of new opportunities.

## Reflecting on my Professional Journey

Bringing us back down to earth, for the past five years, I've been working as a backend software engineer. However, I haven't yet had the chance to work on a real customer-facing product. My first project had no clients by the time I left the company, and now I'm working on internal systems used by other company employees.

Right now, I know I'm lacking many skills needed to successfully build commercial web applications, like marketing, sales, and frontend development. I plan to tackle these deficiencies with my first project, an application dedicated to teaching algorithms and data structures.

## Filling the Gaps in Algorithm Education

For those familiar with the tech industry, the FAANG interview process is no stranger. It typically includes algorithmic exercises and some system design, among other things. Many platforms promise to teach you how to navigate these challenges. After trying some of these platforms, I've noticed they often lack a proper introduction to algorithms and data structures, especially for developers new to these concepts.

My solution is to create a platform with a "game" feel, focusing on teaching users the fundamental algorithms. With this new dev-toolbox, users can confidently move forward to tackle algorithmic interviews.

## Building the MVP: Learning Over Revenue

I'm not expecting this app to be a major source of revenue. As I've stressed, that's not the point of this project. My goal is to build the MVP of the app (including core functionality, a payment system, and user handling). I'll deploy it as economically as possible, try to launch it on platforms like ProductHunt, and kickstart a small marketing campaign.

This process is more about learning and addressing my current skill gaps than generating profit. Let's see where it will take me.
