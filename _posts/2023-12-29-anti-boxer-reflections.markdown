## Introduction
Drawing inspiration from Boxer in Orwell's "Animal Farm," known for his mantras "Napoleon is always right" and "I will work harder," I share my reflections. This text critiques the widespread culture of relentless labor, prevalent globally and recently echoed by influential figures. It's a blend of my observations on mindless labor and servility, especially as I perceive them through the lens of my Polish background. These reflections represent my journey and thoughts, advocating for a balanced and more mindful approach to work and decision-making.

## The Episode at OpenAI: A Glimpse into Polish Servility
The recent events at OpenAI provide insight into Polish cultural tendencies. Sam Altman's firing [led to hasty resignations from Polish employees](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7786/artykul/3283284,key-polish-ai-researchers-leave-openai-amidst-leadership-shakeup), reflecting a propensity for swift, solidarity-driven actions, perhaps reminiscent of the "Napoleon is always right" attitude. In contrast, a more measured response from the wider employee base, involving a petition to reinstate Altman, highlights the difference between culturally influenced impulsive decisions and thoughtful, considered actions. Altman's eventual reinstatement, influenced by this thoughtful petition, underscores the value of reflective decision-making.

## Questioning Relentless Labor
The global and Polish narrative often idolizes relentless, mindless labor, akin to Boxer's "I will work harder" approach. I question this ethos, advocating for a balance that values thoughtful, purposeful work. It involves intellectually engaging with our tasks, seeking meaningful impact, and understanding the reasons behind our efforts, rather than mechanically accumulating work hours.

## Encouraging Thoughtful Skepticism
I envision a culture that promotes questioning and critical thinking, contrasting sharply with the ease of blind loyalty and thoughtless adherence to authority. This mindset, as exemplified by Boxer's blind faith in "Napoleon is always right," is akin to unchallenging conformity. I value a culture where skepticism is encouraged over the simplicity of uncritically following leaders or ideologies.

## Personal Ambition and Intellectual Pursuits
I move away from the often glorified theme of collective struggle and sacrifice, deeply rooted in Polish culture, and instead highlight personal ambition and intellectual growth. Prioritizing individual well-being and success is vital, serving not just as a counter to collective efforts, but as an essential element of personal fulfillment.

## Conclusion: Embracing Thoughtfulness Over Impulsivity
My primary aspiration is to cultivate a more thoughtful approach to action and engagement, moving away from unexamined traditions and impulsive reactions that often characterize my Polish cultural background. It's about seeking deeper self-awareness and reevaluating long-standing norms to create a culture where deliberate, mindful choices are valued above automatic, unreflective behaviors.
